# My CV/Resume
This is done with the [Awesome CV](https://github.com/posquit0/Awesome-CV) template.

My cv contains all information about my professional/extracurricular history. Parts are just commented out depending on what the document is used for.

Only the `mycv/cv.pdf` contains my cv information. Everything else is left over from the examples.
